Our mentors and jury members will be present all the time and their feedback could provide invaluable help to make it to the top of your challenge category. So, while you can theoretically finish your application before ZENCON, the tokens to perform operations on the ZENIQ Smart Chain will only be awarded during ZENCON. So be ready for a lot of last-minute work, little sleep and a lot of energy!",
